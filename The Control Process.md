A 3-part process connects the raw to the automated: [[Virtualization]], [[Legalization]], and [[Automation]]. Each part is both a [[Power]] transfer to the becoming-[[Automaton]] and a metamorphosis into that Automaton.

1. Virtualization is representation in a medium that can be legalized. It reifies the raw into [[Effigies]] suitable for manipulation.
2. Legalization is application of control in the virtualized [[Realm]]. It defines and judges manipulations, and establishes patterns for manipulation.
3. Automation is transformation of the legal patterns, which begin as only substantial within the virtual Realm, into [[Complete]] entities.

## Transfer and Metamorphosis
In the [[Realm]] of Power-[[Bodies]], a Power transfer is a dying and a birthing, or less extremely a symmetrical (absolutely, not proportionately) decay and growth. Since Power sustains life in other realms, this is also a [[Complete]] dying/birthing.

When power is transferred from [[Alice]] to Bob where Bob will fill the same roles as Alice (across all Realms), the transfer is a metamorphosis.
