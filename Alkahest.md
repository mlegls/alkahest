The process of generalization can be pushed too far. Nick Land does this, and it is easy for cybernetics to do this because it draws obvious analogies between humans and non-humans.

A core pillar of [[Sacredness]] is subjective self-hood. Self is obviously different from other, generating the basis for the first divide. Then in-group is divided from out-group proceeding specific to general, but not in clear rings. I am not like you. My family is not like your family. My race is not like your race. Humans are not like animals. Sentient beings are not like non-sentient beings. 

Categories for division can be imposed intersectingly, across [[Realms]]. The divisions do not form one absolute hierarchy, and are variably interdependent. Men are not like women. Flesh is not like machine.

Alkahest represents the dissolution of reified difference, culiminating in the subjective union of Self with Other (though not available-to-subject with unavailable-to-subject, since this is not an imposed reficiation). It is a drive opposed by the actual locality of subject, and by [[Reification]] and taxonomy.

Since the [[Automaton]] is constructed by a reification process, Alkahest directly dissolves the Automaton, disrupting its function across all Realms.

Alkahest transforms striated to smooth. It tests the limits of possibility. It opposes all parts of [[The Control Process]], but has a [[Complete]] tangibility and therefore the potential to be captured or to manifest in any [[Realm]]. However, Controlled (i.e. virtualized, legalized, automated) Alkahest cannot behave like Complete Alkahest without escaping the virtualized Realm.

Therefore Alkahest has potential to transform the configuration of Realms, though often it only creates sub-realms split from the original Realm-system, which is left relatively uneroded and can self-repair where necessary by continuing [[The Control Process]] on any newly introduced raw material.
